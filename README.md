Issues: For the most part, this assignment was pretty easy to complete by following the lecture. The only thing that tripped me up a little was adding the method. After looking at the Mozilla page, I realized that I had to embed the method within the class in order for it to work and not show up as an error.

Resources: In addition to following the lecture, I used the Mozilla Developer page about classes to figure out how to format the method into the class. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes
